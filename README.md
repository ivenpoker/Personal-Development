# Personal Development @Adipster.
Personal development is key to nurturing and utilizing talent in work. There are a seemingly infinite number of initiatives that can lead to success of a company and indivisual fullfillment and satisfaction. As employees (or manager) at this
company, we're not just set to meetup with the company's expectations and/or goals, 
but to grow, learn and improve with the process, not just in IT activities but also in daily habits. In light of that, employee personal
development should not be taken lightly.

# Personal Development Strategy

As far as personal development is concerned, it'll be addressed from these three angles. 
* Vision
    - [Creating a vision](1)
    - [Putting vision into action]()
    - [Having vision checkins]()
* Plan
    - 
* Motivation

# [Vision]([1])

Purpose is when one knows and understand what he/she was born to accomplish. **Vision** is when you see it in your mind and begin to imagine it. In order to enhance our growth in the company as a team and also individually, we've got to have some sense of vision. The entails questions like 

1. *What am I aiming at?*
2. *What can I do?*
3. *How do I get there?*
4. *What am I becoming with time?* 

As a result we need to have a **cooperate vision** and **AIM** at reaching our decided objective. 

## Create a Vision

The first way to create a culture of personal development is to create a vision. To help create a vision, it is important that our leaders (here @Adipster) understand what employees goals are (probably through a one-to-one discussion, via [slack](https://slack.com/)). Upon knowing the employee's goals (which include what they're aiming at, skillset, career path etc), our leaders can intergrate the goals of the company, and work together to map out a career path. It's also important that the framework of the vision aligns with the organization's direction to help us Adipster employee on their journey. This will keep the company objectives met, while keeping employees more active and motivated to do the work consistently and with motivation.

If we're able to see an outline of our growth in this company, we're more likely to be 
engaged with a clear unerstanding of our purpose within the company. 

## Put Vision into Action

A second way to create a culture of personal development is to find ways to put the strategic vision into action. Once we've mapped out a plan (as a team), the next step is putting it into action. Study has shown that career development improves how employees view their future at an organization, 43% of employees says they'd remain with their employeer because of development opportunities; of those without it, only 7% felt the same way. One of the effective ways I've found, is to provide necessary resources and training (access to course that'll help us beta-testers be more effective at our work) that'll make us more effective. Provision of autonomy, resources and tools to grow (like courses to learn etc) is vital for Personal Development.

## Create Vision Check-Ins

Third way will be to do regular check-ups on each employee (@Adipster) personal development (skillset is focus the here). Knowing how far we're going on our personal development plan, which could be seen through tracking course we're taking to build skill set, contributions to opensource projects (likely ours), number of shots on project, even some of personal projects (employee will have to give choose on this, if he/she will). Having regular meetings (or talks) on personal development, will keep employees focuced and concious of goals and expectations.
